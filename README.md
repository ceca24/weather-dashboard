#weather-dashboard

##Description

In this bootcamp challenge, students were tasked with creating a weather dashboard with no pre-set code. Through the challenge, students learned how to use Third-party APIs to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL in retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. Your challenge is to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

##Usage

Copy and past the link in the address bar: https://ceca24.github.io/weather-dashboard/ 

You will be able to click on the "Find a City" section, located on the upper left hand corner of the webpage, and type in the city you would like to see current weather conditions for. Once populated, there will display the 5-day forecast as well. The webpage will looks similar to the screenshot:
